# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

## Description
This project involves creating a 4-wheel robot equipped with 2 ultrasonic distance sensors to detect obstacles and implementing a controller algorithm to enable the robot to autonomously avoid obstacles.

## Components
- 4-wheel robot chassis
- 4 DC motors
- Motor driver module
- 
## Controller Algorithm
The controller algorithm is implemented using Arduino and involves reading distance values from the ultrasonic sensors and adjusting motor speeds based on obstacle detection.

## Simulation Environment
This project utilizes Webots as the simulation environment. Webots provides a realistic 3D simulation platform for testing and validating robot behaviors before deployment on physical hardware.

## Usage
1. Assemble the robot according to the schematic diagram provided.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`obstacle_avoidance_controller.ino`) to the microcontroller board.
3. Use Webots to simulate the robot's behavior and observe its autonomous obstacle avoidance.
