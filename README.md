# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

## Description
This project involves creating a 4-wheel robot equipped with 2 ultrasonic distance sensors to detect obstacles and implementing a controller algorithm to enable the robot to autonomously avoid obstacles.

## Components
- 4-wheel robot chassis
- 4 DC motors
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller
- 2 ultrasonic distance sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Battery pack or power source

## Assembly
1. Assemble the 4-wheel robot chassis and mount the DC motors on it.
2. Connect the motors to the motor driver module, and connect the motor driver module to the Arduino.
3. Connect the ultrasonic distance sensors to the Arduino.
4. Power the Arduino and motors using a suitable power source.

## Controller Algorithm
The controller algorithm is implemented using Arduino and involves reading distance values from the ultrasonic sensors and adjusting motor speeds based on obstacle detection.

## Usage
1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Power on the robot.
3. The robot should now autonomously avoid obstacles detected by the ultrasonic sensors.
